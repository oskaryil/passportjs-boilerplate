# PassportJS Boilerplate
###### A very simple boilerplate/starter kit for PassportJS

### Setup
> Setting up a Facebook OAuth App
```
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
```
> Setting up a Google OAuth App
```
https://console.developers.google.com/
```
> Setting up a Github OAuth App
```
https://github.com/settings/applications/new
```

### Running the Server
```
yarn start
or
npm start
```

### Database
There is no database included in this boilerplate, however, I create a "fake" database. It is just a JSON object, don't be fooled.
